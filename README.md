Walt Disney Animation Capstone Project

Description:
A visually appealing site with nostalgic and charming images of your favorite Disney animations. 

My goal was to replicate Walt Disney Animation website. I added a few of my personal touches through-out the site, for example, I added a page for Disney’s most recent film, “Wish”. I also included the movie trailer. Check it out!

To view locally:
1.	Clone this link to your computer https://github.com/deniseleamoon/code-you-walt-disney-clone
2.	Open Visual Studio Code
3.	Install “Live Server”.
4.	You should be able to view the HTML pages in the web browser.

There are three folders, Home-Page, Events-Page, and Films-Page. Go to the Home-Page folder and you will see an HTML file. Open the HTML file using ‘Open Live Server’.

Voila! You have entered the magical world of Disney! 

Feature Lists:

Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved). 

•	If the user tries to submit the form without entering their name, the user is alerted that a name is mandatory.

•	 If a user submits their email address without the “@“symbol, the user is informed that their entry is missing the “@” symbol.

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
•	I used this feature to countdown to the Wish movie release date.

Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
- I used the YouTube API to retrieve the Wish movie trailer from YouTube.
